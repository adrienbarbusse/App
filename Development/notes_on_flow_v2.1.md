NOTES ON FLOW
=============

Carefully review the flow. There are several changes regarding wireframes. !!!

Modifications & updates of wireframe definitions
------------------------------------------------

+ How old are you = birthday. (better age tracking across time)

+ The first screen if the user do not have an active session is "Welcome" with two UIs: Log in & Sign up.

+ Sign up process start with profile question (birthday, gender, work)

+ If the user exist (email), they will redirected to the log in page. 

+ There is no need to verify email to start using the app, only to send transactionals emails.

+ Validations and communications with the user will be made through a "message machine" with 3 type of message: Info, warning & error.

+ Edit profile is more extensive than the current wireframe version. Maybe is not enough a overlay.

+ END screen in sessions with 3 options:
  
  + Next session

  + Session Start over

  + Go to dashboard

+ Module options: 

  + Reset

  + ON/OFF

+ We need a menu inside each module with at least 3 items: Dashboard (exit session), SOS, Tips.
